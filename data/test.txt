SATD	  important for async scenario we must remove context from current thread so we always create a new rpccontext for the next invoke for the same thread	 
SATD	  todo to move somewhere else better	 
SATD	  fixme now we need to check first then load	 
SATD	  todo contextsessions is the best option here in jetty x it becomes servletcontexthandlersessions	 
SATD	  todo move names to constants	 
SATD	  ignore concurrent problem 	 
SATD	  todo add this to provider config	 
SATD	  special treatment of array values was suggested by lizongbo 	 
SATD	  todo we should leave this setting to slf j	 
SATD	  fixme when the thread pool is full server threadpool exhausted error cannot return properly therefore the consumer side has to wait until gets timeout this is a temporary solution to prevent this scenario from happening but a better solution should be considered later	 
SATD	  the initial value is null and the midway may be assigned to null please use the local variable reference	 
SATD	  fixme request context	 
SATD	  for example object transported on the wire doesn t implement serializable	 
SATD	  bug dubbo 	 
SATD	  fixme log error message in codec and handle in caught of iohanndler 	 
SATD	  there may be some problem handling chinese negative number recognition ignoring this problem the backspace key is only meaningfully input in a real telnet program	 
SATD	  this ut is unstable consider remove it later see httpsgithubcomapachedubboissues 	 
SATD	  bug dubbo 	 
SATD	  todo do more sophisticated exception handling and output	 
SATD	  todo for now kryo serialization doesn t deny classes that don t implement the serializable interface pre eg ltdubboprotocol serializationkryo gt pre 	 
SATD	  todo users can override this mapper but we just rely on the current priority strategy of resteasy	 
SATD	  fixme waiting for embedded nacos suport then we can open the switch	 
SATD	  todo generic invoker 	 
SATD	  fixme this instance will always be a type of dynamicconfiguration configcenterconfig will load the instance at startup and assign it to here 	 
SATD	  todo do not want to use spaces see dubbo url class handles special conventions for special characters	 
SATD	  hack use reflection to get the shared channel	 
SATD	  todo notification failure does not restore mechanism guarantee	 
SATD	  todo fix npe contextisproviderside	 
SATD	  todo we needs use force writing to file so that buffer gets clear and new log can be written	 
SATD	  reselect before retry to avoid a change of candidate invokers note if invokers changed then invoked also lose accuracy	 
SATD	  todo load as spi will be better 	 
SATD	  fixme reject exception can not be sent to consumer because thread pool is full resulting in consumers waiting till timeout	 
SATD	  todo refactor using mockito 	 
SATD	  generally a client can only be closed once here it is closed twice counter is incorrect	 
SATD	  todo a temporary solution to the problem that the exception information can not be sent to the opposite end after the thread pool is full need a refactoring fix the thread pool is full refuses to call does not return and causes the consumer to wait for time out	 
SATD	  todo in the future maybe we can just use a single rest client and connection manager	 
SATD	  todo solve merge problem constantsdefault stub event	 
SATD	  fixme a hack to make orgapachedubboremotingexchangesupportdefaultfutureclosechannel work	 
SATD	  is the buffer big enough 	 
SATD	  bug dubbo in version config retryfalse on provider s method doesn t work	 
SATD	  fixme this exposes the design flaw in routerchain	 
SATD	  fixme response context	 
SATD	  todo jetty will by default enable keepalive so the xml config has no effect now	 
SATD	  cannot write not available 	 
SATD	  todo wrapper cannot handle this scenario correctly the classname contains 	 
SATD	  on server side thrift can not handle exceptions not declared in idl	 
SATD	  todo assert error log	 
SATD	  this class represents an unfinished rpc call it will hold some context information for this call for example rpccontext and invocation so that when the call finishes and the result returns it can guarantee all the contexts being recovered as the same as when the call was made before any callback is invoked p todo if it s reasonable or even right to keep a reference to invocation p as link result implements completionstage link asyncrpcresult allows you to easily build a async filter chain whose status will be driven entirely by the state of the underlying rpc call p asyncrpcresult does not contain any concrete value except the underlying value bring by completablefuture consider it as a status transfer node link getvalue and link getexception are all inherited from link result interface implementing them are mainly for compatibility consideration because many legacy link filter implementation are most possibly to call getvalue directly 	 
SATD	  fixme should put exception in future 	 
SATD	  dubbo methods key in provider s urlone doesn t contain the methods from inherited super interface	 
SATD	  contextfiltertestjava todo need to enhance assertion 	 
SATD	  fixme this code looks useless	 
SATD	  todo due to dubbo s current architecture it will be called from registry protocol in the shutdown process and won t appear in logs	 
SATD	  todo can we load successfully for a different classloader 	 
SATD	  the status input has a problem and the read information is wrong when the serialization is serialized	 
SATD	  fixme not sure why abstractreferenceconfig has both isgeneric and getgeneric	 
SATD	  fixme result is an asyncrpcresult instance	 
SATD	  fixme should cancel and restart timer tasks if parameters in the new url are different 	 
SATD	  todo extract more code here if necessary 	 
SATD	  fixme rmi protocol doesn t support casting to echoservice yet	 
SATD	  dubbo s original impl can t support the use of servletcontext serveraddhandlerservlethandler	 
SATD	  deprecated subscribe to override rules in x or before	 
SATD	  subscribe the override data fixme when the provider subscribes it will affect the scene a certain jvm exposes the service and call the same service because the subscribed is cached key with the name of the service it causes the	 
SATD	  should be called after config was fully initialized fixme this method should be completely replaced by appendparameters return see abstractconfig appendparametersmap object string p notice this method should include all properties in the returning map treat parameter differently compared to appendparameters 	 
SATD	  todo can the value returned by getchannel be null need improvement	 
SATD	  todo to support wildcards	 
SATD	  fixme cannot guarantee the sequence of the merge result check implementation in mergeableclusterinvoker invoke	 
SATD	  fixme is there any need of failing back to constantsany value or the first available method invokers when invokers is null 	 
SATD	  todo more configs to add	 
SATD	  bug dubbo provider doesn t have exception output and consumer has timeout error when serialization fails	 
SATD	  fixme there s no place to release connectionexecutor 	 
SATD	  todo refactor it	 
SATD	  todo this may not be a pretty elegant solution 	 
SATD	  fixme log error info in codec and put all error handle logic in iohanndler 	 
SATD	  can t shutdown nioeventloopgroup because the method will be invoked when closing one channel but not a client but when and how to close the nioeventloopgroup nioeventloopgroupshutdowngracefully	 
SATD	  fixme is this really necessary propertiesconfiguration should have already covered this see propertiesconfiguration see configutils getpropertystring 	 
SATD	  the resident routers must being initialized before address notification fixme this method should not be public 	 
SATD	  todo there may have duplicate refresh	 
SATD	  fixme replace this with better method	 
SATD	  todo for now we don t consider the differences of encoding and server limit	 
SATD	  fixme check parameterrequiredtrue and any conditions that need to match 	 
SATD	  rmi needs extra parameter since it uses customized remote invocation object the customized remoteinvocation was firstly introduced in v the package was renamed to orgapache since v considering the above two conditions we need to check before sending customized remoteinvocation if the provider version is v or higher send orgapachedubborpcprotocolrmirmiremoteinvocation if the provider version is v or higher send comalibabadubborpcprotocolrmirmiremoteinvocation if the provider version is lower than v does not use customized remoteinvocation 	 
SATD	  todo exist concurrent gap	 
SATD	  todo fixme the thread pool should be used to refresh the address otherwise the task may be accumulated	 
SATD	  if there s no dynamic tag rule being set use static tag in url p a typical scenario is a consumer using version x calls providers using version x or lower the consumer should always respect the tag in provider url regardless of whether a dynamic tag rule has been set to it or not p todo to guarantee consistent behavior of interoperability between and this method should has the same logic with the tagrouter in x param invokers param url param invocation param t return

SATD	  this is not super nice but dependencies are created through reflection for decoration and assume a constructor with arguments group name version which is suitable for most cases we could create an empty attribute set directly in the abstractdependencyimpl but then it wouldn t be mutable therefore we proceed with late injection of the attributes	 
SATD	  todoew consider whether this belongs in console or here	 
SATD	  todo should split this up so that the inputs are attached to an object that represents the binary which is then later used to configure the linkassemble tasks

SATD	  todo include link to documentation giving more explanation of what s going on here	 
SATD	  todo migrate this away from here	 
SATD	  this looks ugly very ugly but that is apparently what ant does itself	 
SATD	  todo should be incremental	 
SATD	  todo this is terrible	 
SATD	  todo this should actually be a routable message with a single handler but we need some way to correlate a given request with a specific response channel	 
SATD	  todo this is pretty nasty look at avoiding using a time bomb stub here	 
SATD	  todorbo change the parameter type to transformer string nullable string once we migrate to java 	 
SATD	  todo make this work on windows originalinclose	 
SATD	  todo better exception type	 
SATD	  note this would be better housed in a scope that encapsulated the tree of gradle objects	 
SATD	  a link orggradleapifileconfigurablefilecollection that can be used as a task input property caches the matching set of files during task execution and discards the result after task execution todo disallow further changes to this collection once task has started todo keep the file entries to snapshot later to avoid a stat on each file during snapshot 	 
SATD	  todo this class defaultbuildoperationqueue and executionplan have many of the same behavior and concerns we should look for a way to generalize this pattern	 
SATD	  todoinstantexecution remove this	 
SATD	  can only set once should really be part of the constructor can only set once should really be part of the constructor	 
SATD	  this isn t quite right as we may lose precision when converting to a double	 
SATD	  decimalformat is not thread safe synchronize access to the instance	 
SATD	  todo wire this stuff in properly	 
SATD	  todoadam need to cleanup completion too if not used	 
SATD	  todo need to check for proper typecast	 
SATD	  todo should use a resolver so that this method is consistent with projecturistring	 
SATD	  todo wolfs schedule fingerprinting separately it can be done without having the project lock	 
SATD	  note don t actually remove this in the deprecation is here to encourage people to use objectfactory instead just remove the overload and the nag and leave the method here	 
SATD	  todo consider multithreadingmultiprocess issues teamcity has the concept of a wave of messages where each threadprocess uses a unique wave id	 
SATD	  todo reduce duplication with swift binary	 
SATD	  todo move bootclasspath to platform	 
SATD	  todo this should be modeled as a source set	 
SATD	  todo the project model should be reachable from projectstate without another lookup	 
SATD	  todo locate this tool from a tool provider hide main symbol	 
SATD	  todo this prefix shouldn t be hardcoded	 
SATD	  todolptr remove projection for reference node this shouldn t be needed but if there s no actual value referenced model report can only show the type of the node if we do this for now it should use the schema instead to find the type of the property node instead	 
SATD	  todoadam switch the logging back on need to make sending messages from daemon to client async wrt log event generation loggerdebugignoring failure to extract throwable stack trace ignored	 
SATD	  todo need failure handling eg cannot clone repository	 
SATD	  todo this should actually compare a sortedset	 
SATD	  todo validate that it s a valid model path	 
SATD	  the visual c tools use the path to find other executables todoadam restrict this to the specific path for the target tool	 
SATD	  todopm move this to warn level once we fixed mavenpublish see gradlegradle 	 
SATD	  todoadam this isn t quite right mb i think refers to the first capable classloader loading the class this could be different from the loader which originally loaded it which could pose equality and lifecycle issues	 
SATD	  todocedric this is an approximation when a component wants to compile against the assembly of a library not the jar then we should give it the stubbed classes instead of the raw classes however there s no such thing as a stubbed classes assembly for performance reasons only the classes that belong to the api are stubbed so we would miss the classes that do not belong to the api so this makes the usagekindapi misleading should this be compile 	 
SATD	  an immutable view of the variant of a component todo this should replace or merge into variantresolvemetadata outgoingvariant configurationmetadata 	 
SATD	  because it s a capability conflict resolution there is only one candidate per module identifier so we can be lenient wrt the version number used in the descriptor which helps whenever the user used the convenience notation method	 
SATD	  todo improve lookup by reusing availablejavahomes testfixture for now we play it safe and just return false	 
SATD	  todo should decorate	 
SATD	  todo removing this stuff from the store should be handled through some sort of decoration	 
SATD	  todo fix the way we work out which exception is important taskexecutionexception is not always the most helpful	 
SATD	  todo do we need any factories here 	 
SATD	  todohh this should be moved back into languagenative project	 
SATD	  todo make this work with pending elements	 
SATD	  todo ultimately this should be some kind of rd party dependency that s visible to dependency management	 
SATD	  todo these should come from somewhere else probably	 
SATD	  todo this should become smarter and move into the compiler infrastructure instead of the task similar to how the other native languages are done for now this does a rudimentary incremental build analysis by looking at which files changed 	 
SATD	  a minimal resolver which does not use any native services used during bootstrap only you should generally use link fileresolver instead todo share more stuff with abstractfileresolver 	 
SATD	  a list instance is needed here as orggradleinternalsnapshotvaluesnapshotterprocessvalue does not support serializing iterators directly	 
SATD	  todolptr this should be added only if the scan plugin is applied but snapshottaskinputsoperationintegrationtest todolptr expects it to be added also when the build cache is enabled but not the scan plugin	 
SATD	  todo we should set this for macos but this currently breaks xctest support for swift when swift depends on c libraries built by gradle	 
SATD	  todolptr when we drop java support we can switch to using classloadergetname instead of storing our own	 
SATD	  todo provide an abstraction for accessing resources within the same module mavenmetadata directory listing etc that way we can avoid passing ivypatterns and artifactpatterns around everywhere	 
SATD	  todoinstantexecution remove kotlin predicate after updating the wrapper	 
SATD	  closes the tooling api releasing all resources blocks until completed p may attempt to expire some or all daemons started by this tooling api client the exact behaviour here is implementationspecific and not guaranteed the expiration is best effort only this method may return before the daemons have stopped p p note this is not yet part of the public tooling api yet p todo need to model this as a long running operation and allow stdout stderr and progress listener to be supplied todo need to define exceptions todo no further operations are allowed after this has been called todo cancel current operations or block until complete todo introduce a tooling api client interface and move this method there 	 
SATD	  todo ld use something more stable than a cast here	 
SATD	  todo make this more intelligent by matching the attributes of the runtime usage on the variant identities	 
SATD	  workaround for backwards compatibility previously this case would unintentionally cause the method to be invoked on the owner continue below	 
SATD	  todo capitalise the target name in the task name todo don t create a launch target for a library	 
SATD	  create binaries for test suites todo this should really be a componentbinaries rule but at this point we have no clue what the concrete binary type is so everything has to be duplicated in specific plugins see usages for example 	 
SATD	  did we already consider it as an output after the previous execution 	 
SATD	  todo to get rid of this we need a functionalsourceset instance here and that s surprisingly difficult to get	 
SATD	  todo generic model related super exception 	 
SATD	  todo this should work for any build rather than just an included build	 
SATD	  workaround for httpsissuesgradleorgbrowsegradle 	 
SATD	  todo we basically don t support copying custom javadoc options	 
SATD	  todo this exists because we detect all available native tool chains on a system clang gcc swiftc msvc many of our old tests assume that available tool chains can compile manymost languages so they do not try to restrict the required set of tool chains the swiftc tool chain can build only swift so tests that expect to use the swiftc tool chain properly annotate their requirements with toolchainrequirementswiftc or a versionspecific requirement our multitest runner is smart enough to disable tests that do not meet the test s requirements but since many of the old tests do not have requirements we assume the tests require a c like tool chain gcc clang msvc in the future we want to go back to old tests and annotate them with tool chains requirements	 
SATD	  we don t handle variables at the moment because users didn t request it yet and it would probably push us to add support in the tooling api to retrieve the variable mappings	 
SATD	  todo versionselector should be more descriptive so it can be directly translated	 
SATD	  todolptr should be a contentless inputdirectory	 
SATD	  todo need a smarter way to map usage to artifact classifier	 
SATD	  todo once source compatibility is raised to this should be rewritten using the javaniofilesystem api which can deal with jars and folders the same way instead of duplicating code 	 
SATD	  todo better exception	 
SATD	  todo sf this method accepts closure instance as parameter but does not work correctly for it	 
SATD	  todo find a better way to present this information in the error message attempt to mimic gradle nested exception output	 
SATD	  todo we should really find a better solution for this maybe we could use a filterreader instead of a filterinputstream 	 
SATD	  not fully accurate but a sensible fallback see httpstackoverflowcomquestions howdoidetectwhetherthefilesystemiscasesensitive	 
SATD	  todo not sure if we can clean up the generics here and do less unchecked casting	 
SATD	  todo deal with more than one header dir eg generated public headers	 
SATD	  todo projectdependency should be transformed based on defaultproject and other context elsewhere	 
SATD	  todo this will have to be changed when we support setting credentials directly on the authentication	 
SATD	  todo this is an approximation as we know swift currently supports only bit runtimes eventually we ll want to query for this	 
SATD	  todo the async work tracker should wait for children of an operation to finish first it should not be necessary to call it here	 
SATD	  todo reduce duplication with c binary	 
SATD	  todo this should be more specific to just the tasks that create the class files 	 
SATD	  todo we aren t considering the filter	 
SATD	  send a endofline this is a workaround to convince the console that the cursor is at the start of the line to avoid indenting the next line of text that is displayed it would be better for the console to listen for stuff read from stdin that would also be echoed to the output and update its state based on this	 
SATD	  todo exception when type cannot be created	 
SATD	  todo bind with the sourcecompatibility property todo link to runtime configuration 	 
SATD	  we track this as an input since the scala compiler output may depend on it todo this should be replaced by a property in the scala toolchain as soon as we model these	 
SATD	  todolptr instead of the first view property we should figure out these parameters from the actual property	 
SATD	  todo dsl documentation 	 
SATD	  todo we can probably now support more versions with strictly but we ll need more test coverage	 
SATD	  todo move this to objectfactory	 
SATD	  there are some exceptions attached to the suite let s make sure they are reported to the user this may happen for example when suite initialisation fails and no tests are executed	 
SATD	  todo does a static library have runtime elements 	 
SATD	  todolptr this ignores changes to projectbuilddir after model node has been created	 
SATD	  todolptr remove projection for reference node this shouldn t be needed but if there s no actual value referenced model report can only show the type of the node if we do this for now it should use the schema instead to find	 
SATD	  todo what if this errors 	 
SATD	  todoinstantexecution remove this	 
SATD	  todo remove this special case	 
SATD	  need to move those implicit jvm args that contain a space to the gradle commandline if possible note that this isn t strictly correct as some system properties can only be set on jvm start up should change the implementation to deal with these properly	 
SATD	  doesn t really make sense	 
SATD	  typeonly model reference of type s s is ambiguous as multiple model elements are available for this type n s created by s n s created by s	 
SATD	  todo exceptions thrown here should point to some extensive documentation on the concept of class rule sources	 
SATD	  sf this is a workaround until this story is completed i m hardcoding setting the idle timeout to be max x mins this way we avoid potential runaway daemons that steal resources on linux and break builds on windows	 
SATD	  todo move this to a base plugin setup the dependency on the main binary this should all be replaced by a single dependency that points at some testable variants of the main binary	 
SATD	  todo should we support this adds a void propnameobject value method that simply delegates to the converting setter method	 
SATD	  todo send a message to workers to change their log level rather than stopping	 
SATD	  todo this should also be using the decorating instantiator but cannot for backwards compatibility	 
SATD	  todo visit the contents of this collection instead this is just a super simple implementation for now	 
SATD	  todo we should get rid of this reflection will need to reimplement the parser to act on the metadata directly	 
SATD	  todo do we want to keep using sourcedirectoryset in the new api would feel more natural if dirs could be added directly to languagesourceset could also think about extending sourcedirectoryset	 
SATD	  todolptr this should be removed once binarycontainer is a modelmap we need to also implement all the interfaces of the delegate type because otherwise binarycontainer won t recognize managed binaries as binaryspecinternal	 
SATD	  todo stream serialised value to file todo handle hash collisions properly this time todo don t store null links to child blocks in leaf index blocks todo align block boundaries todo thread safety control todo merge small values into a single data block todo discard when file corrupt todo include data directly in index entry when serializer can guarantee small fixed sized data todo free list leaks disk space todo merge adjacent free blocks todo use more efficient lookup for free block with nearest size	 
SATD	  this is a workaround for httpsissuesgradleorgbrowsegradle somehow the arraylist result in orgsonatypeaetherimplinternalutils sortmetadatageneratorfactories ends up being a list of nulls on windows and ibm s jdk	 
SATD	  todo binaries aren t an input to this rule they re an input to the action	 
SATD	  specifies how to build and where to place a native executable file p todohh resolve naming conflict with existing nativeexecutablespec p 	 
SATD	  this should be replaced by some stronger modelling and made open rather than hardcoding a set of source languages here	 
SATD	  we moved the api back into internal so this isn t really correct	 
SATD	  todo refactor this action out so it can be unit tested	 
SATD	  todo error if there are unknowns 	 
SATD	  todoadam using a uuid means we create a classloader hierarchy for each daemon process we talk to instead use the spec to decide whether to reuse a classloader	 
SATD	  todo should supply and check for the same parameters as passed to reservenewclient	 
SATD	  todo should use the install task for an executable	 
SATD	  implement this if you need to specify individual toolchains via orggradleintegtestversions	 
SATD	  todo annotate as required	 
SATD	  todo cc cannot enable this assertion because modulesource is not serialized so doesn t appear in the deserialized form assert metadataequalsforceread	 
SATD	  todo an excluderule is a value object but we don t enforce immutability for defaultexcluderule as strong as we should we expose the map we should provide a better api for excluderule i don t want to use unmodifiable map as soon as defaultexcluderule is truly immutable we don t need to create a new instance of defaultexcluderule	 
SATD	  production code should handle these exceptions more gracefully	 
SATD	  todo this isn t quite right	 
SATD	  the isempty check is not required might look innocent but guava s performance bad for an empty immutable list because it still creates an inner class for an iterator which delegates to an array iterator which does nothing so just adding this check has a significant impact because most components do not declare any capability	 
SATD	  todo we are relying on the registration having established these links we should be checking	 
SATD	  todo sf add quotes to both formats there will be lots of tests failing so i m not sure if it is worth it	 
SATD	  todoew consider whether this belongs in buildprogressarea or here	 
SATD	  todo it would be better if these were added via a separate managed view rather than hard coded	 
SATD	  shouldn t really be here currently this goal is used by link bindallreferences which also expects the subject to be bound	 
SATD	  this doesn t work it used to because at the bottom of the hierarchy chain the object implemented methodmissing however our normal decorated classes do not do this so it is not realistic	 
SATD	  todo this returns the wrong public type for domain objects created with the eager apis or added directly to the container this can leak internal types we do not currently keep track of the type used when creating a domain object via create or the type of the container when a domain object is added directly via add	 
SATD	  todolptr what happens when the property has multiple accessors in the same role but with different type 	 
SATD	  todo should not be ignoring dependency attribute modifications after resolve	 
SATD	  todo this should be a container of platforms	 
SATD	  todo hack to avoid classloading issues we should use orggradleutiltextutil currently we can t use it reliably because it causes cnf issues with cross version integration tests running against tooling api 	 
SATD	  todo else verify that the build definition is the same	 
SATD	  todo make this lazy	 
SATD	  todo should this take object 	 
SATD	  used by the kotlindsl base plugin todo remove this	 
SATD	  todo sources is not actual an input to binaries it s an input to each binary	 
SATD	  todo mix in groovy support using bytecode decoration instead todo validate closure parameters to check they are within bounds	 
SATD	  todo this class attempts to mimic the behavior of the output of mvn helpeffectivepom instead of this class we should walk the maven project object model instead of parsing the xml 	 
SATD	  we have a name foobar and an import foofoo this means foobar is possibly foofoobar rather than foobar this means to cut at the dot in foobar and foo for import 	 
SATD	  todo remove this once the above is removed	 
SATD	  this is a workaround for httpsgithubcomgradlegradleprivateissues 	 
SATD	  todo only here because kotlin dsl uses this please remove once that is fixed 	 
SATD	  hold the lock while creating the connection not generally good form in this instance blocks other threads from creating the connection at the same time	 
SATD	  currently retains strong references to types that are not loaded using a visitableurlclassloader this is fine for jvm types but a problem when a custom classloader is used which should probably be deprecated instead of supported	 
SATD	  we might fail hard here on the assumption that something weird happened to the daemon however since we haven t yet started running the build we can recover by just trying again	 
SATD	  todo improve configuration of reports	 
SATD	  todo fix tests that rely on this being set before we process arguments like this	 
SATD	  todo turn into set 	 
SATD	  there s a potential problem here in that disconnectableinputstream reads from input in the background this won t automatically stop when the process is over therefore if input is not closed then this thread will run forever it would be better to ensure that this thread stops when the process does 	 
SATD	  todo need to do a better job of routing messages when there are multiple endpoints this is just going to forward all queued messages to the first waiting endpoint even if there are multiple waiting to do work	 
SATD	  create test suite component todo reuse logic from swiftplugin todo component name and extension name aren t the same todo should use srcxctestswift as the convention add the test suite and extension	 
SATD	  do not use this it s here because some of the services this type needs are not easily accessed in certain cases and will be removed ay some point use one of the other methods instead	 
SATD	  todo should validate that clazz is of a non parameterized type	 
SATD	  workaround for when the task is given an input file that doesn t exist	 
SATD	  todo figure out how to get rid of origin scope id in snapshot outputs step	 
SATD	  get rid of the ivy token as are not valid uri characters	 
SATD	  todo remove this property once configuration can handle normal file system dependencies	 
SATD	  this piece of ugliness copies the jaxp ie xml api provider if any from the system classloader here s why when looking for a provider jaxp looks for a service resource in the context classloader which is our isolated classloader if our classpath above does not contain a provider this returns null if it does contain a provider jaxp extracts the classname from the service resource if not found jaxp looks for a service resource in the system classloader this happens to include all the application classes specified on the classpath if the application classpath does not contain a provider this returns null if it does contain a provider jaxp extracts the implementation classname from the service resource if not found jaxp uses a default classname jaxp attempts to load the provider using the context classloader which is our isolated classloader this is fine if the classname came from step or it blows up if the classname came from step so as a workaround locate and make visible xml parser classes from the system classloader in our isolated classloader note that in practise this is only triggered when running in our tests	 
SATD	  todo will be implemented without hardcoded access to gradle user homegradleproperties for in 	 
SATD	  todo this hardcodes the assumption of a compile configuration on the external module instead we should be creating an api configuration for each resolved module	 
SATD	  this is a legacy quirk scans use this to determine that progress logging is indicating startfinish of tasks this can be removed in gradle along with the concept of a logging category of an operation	 
SATD	  see the comment in taskcompleted above for why this is here and why this is a problem	 
SATD	  todo cc the special casing of virtual platform should go away if we can implement disambiguation of variants for a single component	 
SATD	  todo this should actually extend from the api dependencies but since swift currently requires all dependencies to be treated like api dependencies with transitivity we just use the implementation dependencies here see httpsbugsswiftorgbrowsesr 	 
SATD	  todo replace this with jvmassembly once that type is public	 
SATD	  this is not very nice might be good enough until we get rid of resolvedconfiguration and friends avoid traversing the graph causing the full resolveddependency graph to be loaded for the most typical scenario	 
SATD	  not implemented not yet required please implement if required	 
SATD	  todo extract the nonfilesystem parts of the filesystemchangewaiter into a separate interface this isn t really tied to file system watching we just need another type of waiter	 
SATD	  todo this class sources gradle metadata files but there s no corresponding modulecomponentresolvemetadata for this metadata yet because of this we will generate an empty instance either a ivy or maven based on the repository type 	 
SATD	  todo this isn t correct assumes that a side effect is to add the element	 
SATD	  todo classes should be a little more tied to the classesdirs for a sourceset so every plugin doesn t need to do this	 
SATD	  this is really not cool but we cannot rely on readattributes because it will throw an exception if the file is missing which is really incredibly slow just to determine if a file exists or not	 
SATD	  todo use twirl library instead 	 
SATD	  do not use this constructor directly it s only there for backwards compatibility with the nebula plugin	 
SATD	  groovy does something very strange here for some reason probably because the class is java it won t employ any dynamism even implementing invokemethod at the java level has no effect	 
SATD	  todo we should see if we can go back to using httpclient again this implementation is borrowed from the apache httpclient project httpsgithubcomapachehttpclientblob httpclientsrcmainjavaorgapachehttpconnsslsslsocketfactoryjava l l 	 
SATD	  todo change to set 	 
SATD	  tododaniel should support in a better way multi file invocation override this method to have multi file invocation	 
SATD	  todo refactor this task configuration to extend a copy task and use replace tokens	 
SATD	  todoreuse refactor after removing reuse this is horrendously bad we need to set the platform before the defaults rules of nativebinaryrules assign the toolchain we can t just assign the toolchain here because the initializer would be closing over the toolchain which is not reusable and this breaks model reuse so here we are just closing over the safely reusable things and then using proper dependencies for the tool chain registry unfortunately we can t do it in the create action because that would fire after defaults rules we have to use a defaults rule to assign the tool chain because it needs to be there in user mutate rules or at least the file locations do so that they can be tweaked ld 	 
SATD	  check enum equality without checking loading classloader there is a slight risk that two versions of the same enum class are compared that s why classloaders are used in equality checks but checking both name and ordinal should make this very unlikely	 
SATD	  todo version could be different from main artifact s version	 
SATD	  should really be a parameter to the withcontent methods or baked into the accessor	 
SATD	  todo error messages todo display names for this container and the provider implementations	 
SATD	  not subtypes as we don t know whether they are immutable or not	 
SATD	  todo this check should really be done in the compiler process	 
SATD	  forced dependencies are only supported for enforced platforms so it is currently hardcoded should we want to add this as a first class concept to gradle metadata then it should be available on the component variant metadata as well	 
SATD	  todo remove this attempt to guess packaging from artifacts packaging should come from component or be explicitly set	 
SATD	  was it created during execution 	 
SATD	  todo deprecate and eventually prevent these mutations when already resolved	 
SATD	  todo this doesn t quite guarantee immutability because the source may be holding closures that are doing god knows what	 
SATD	  todo get rid of destinationdirectory entirely and replace it with a collection of link outputs	 
SATD	  todo migrate this to the worker api once the filesystem and fileoperations services can be injected	 
SATD	  todolptr have the paths of the projects serve as input maybe 	 
SATD	  this could be handled just not implemented yet	 
SATD	  todo wrong using the full classpath of the application	 
SATD	  this is not very beautiful but at some point we will get rid of archiveoutputstreamfactory in favor of the writable resource	 
SATD	  this if is a bit cheesy but letter classname surely means a generic type and the warning will be useless	 
SATD	  creates an instance of the given task type without invoking its constructors this is used to recreate a task instance from the instant execution cache todoinstantexecution review this 	 
SATD	  todo this selection should happen per target platform	 
SATD	  todo resolve the javaplatform and scalaplatform from their platformresolvers rather than instantiating directly	 
SATD	  todo should include some context on what the rule was trying to do create vs mutate	 
SATD	  todo get this from somewhere else 	 
SATD	  this is here to trigger creation of the shutdowncoordinator could do this in a nicer way	 
SATD	  todopm move this to runasbuildoperationbuildactionrunner when buildoperationworkerregistry scope is changed	 
SATD	  todo outputeventlistener and buildstandardinput are perbuild settings so down the road we should refactor the code accordingly and potentially attach them to buildactionparameters	 
SATD	  exposes methods for those properties whose value is a closure todo use composition instead of inheritance 	 
SATD	  platform specific arguments todo need to lazily configure compile task	 
SATD	  if this occurs while running gradle or running integration tests it is indicative of a problem if this occurs while running unit tests then either use the nativeservicestestfixture or the usesnativeservices annotation	 
SATD	  ugly but there are a few places where we need to instantiate a javadebugoptions and a regular objectfactory service is not available	 
SATD	  todo adding the parent project first because the converter needs it this way atm this is oversimplified the converter should not depend on the order of reactor projects we should add coverage for nested multiproject builds with multiple parents	 
SATD	  there s a possibility that this listener is called concurrently with the build finished listener if the message happens to be a graceful expire one then there s a large risk that we create a deadlock because we re trying to remove the same listener from different notifications to avoid this we just set the reference to null which says that we re taking care of removing the listener	 
SATD	  todo need to track versionimplementation of ar tool	 
SATD	  this is copied from ant see orgapachetoolsantutilfileutilstryhardtodelete it mentions that there is a bug in the windows jdk impls that this is a valid workaround for i ve been unable to find a definitive reference to this bug the thinking is that if this is good enough for ant it s good enough for us	 
SATD	  todo change this to only add swift api artifacts and instead parse modulemaps to discover compile task inputs	 
SATD	  rough implementation to get something to work	 
SATD	  todo remove these special cases	 
SATD	  todo this is not a great paradigm for creating a temporary directory see httpguavalibrariesgooglecodecomsvntagsrelease javadoccomgooglecommoniofileshtml createtempdir for an alternative	 
SATD	  todo this should be part of the cached result 	 
SATD	  implementation is currently dumb can be made smarter	 
SATD	  todorbo clarify what it means and what s possible to do with it todorbo eg can the return value always be used to resolve back to the identified component if so how todorbo wouldn t it be better to define a proper type for projectmodel paths 	 
SATD	  todo this can throw a npe will need an identifier for a variant without an owning component	 
SATD	  this implementation is broken it does not consider include and exclude patterns	 
SATD	  todo lja using the root as the nodestate here is a bit of a cheat investigate if we can track the proper nodestate	 
SATD	  produces an artifactidentifier for this artifact it s not actually an identifier just a bucket of attributes todoadam remove this 	 
SATD	  todo property order needs to be deterministic across jvm invocations ie sort the properties by name	 
SATD	  todo this will leave invalid types in the cache when it fails	 
SATD	  should repositories be able to participate in incremental at the least they may be able to express themselves as output files they might have input files and other dependencies as well though inputs the credentials they need may be expressed in a file dependencies can t think of a case here	 
SATD	  todo have to do much better here	 
SATD	  todo these should be moved off to a separate type	 
SATD	  todolptr this should be defaults each playapplicationbinaryspecinternal	 
SATD	  todo we should refactor this to general compatibility mapping solution as we have it for model loading see hascompatibilitymapping class	 
SATD	  this is a heuristic more than truth it is possible that the long hashs are identical and that the sizes of collections are identical but it s extremely unlikely never happened on test cases even on large dependency graph	 
SATD	  failing seems to be that set method override doesn t work for iterables gradle assertthatcall bean list beanthingslist bean new linkedlist object nullvalue assertthatbeangetthingssize equalto 	 
SATD	  todo this isn t quite right we re leaking the implementation type here but for tasks this is usually right	 
SATD	  todo return a richer data structure that provides meta data about how the source was found for use is diagnostics	 
SATD	  the configuration has been used in a resolution and it is an error for build logic to change any dependencies exclude rules or parent configurations values that will affect the resolved graph	 
SATD	  this method is sometimes called directly ie not via an operation executor in these cases the context is null	 
SATD	  todolptr what is with the metaclass property here 	 
SATD	  todo this doesn t belong here that java plugin should add an extension to this guy with this	 
SATD	  need to make this better	 
SATD	  todo maybe we need to allow additional dirs like sourcesetoutput does esp for backwards compatibility wonder if it s still necessary to distinguish between classes and resources dirs instead of just maintaining a collection of dirs as far as generated resources are concerned it might be better to model them as an additional buildable resourceset	 
SATD	  workaround for bug in testng apparently fixed in some x listener is notified twice per event	 
SATD	  todo this isn t correct this means that we ve detected a cycle while determining the execution plan but the graph walker did not find one httpsgithubcomgradlegradleissues 	 
SATD	  todocedric the following validation should in theory happen in its own rule but it is not possible now because there s no way to iterate on the map as subject of a validate rule without gradle thinking you re trying to mutate it	 
SATD	  todo simplify this class by busting it up into a locator for legacy sdks and locators for windows kits	 
SATD	  todo this is all terribly lame we need some proper reporting here which means implementing reporting	 
SATD	  todo implement these cases	 
SATD	  tododaniel swift compiler should extends from an abstraction of nativecompiler most of it applies to swiftcompiler	 
SATD	  todo should use target platform to make this decision	 
SATD	  todo there should be a more explicit way to execute an action against existing services	 
SATD	  have an unprocessednew selector for this module need to reselect the target version	 
SATD	  todo assets should probably be a source set too	 
SATD	  todoinstantexecution use the class generator instead	 
SATD	  todo implement this by moving this resolver to live alongside the external resolvers	 
SATD	  todo this should use the same mutationvalidator infrastructure that we use for other mutation types	 
SATD	  todo we should just cache these classloaders and ejectstop them when they are no longer in use	 
SATD	  todo should be self closed	 
SATD	  todolptr we should collect all source sets in the project source set however this messes up componentreportrenderer	 
SATD	  todo only log expired workers count log their identity once they are nameabledescribable	 
SATD	  todo this is not nice work out a better way to collect the plugin requests from invoking the plugins block	 
SATD	  todo this is a braindead way to ensure that the reference project s model is ready to access	 
SATD	  todo this is not quite right eg given a a b b the result should be b a and a b but will in fact be b and a 	 
SATD	  the very first event starts the initializing phase todo should use buildrequestmetadata to determine the build start time	 
SATD	  one should really avoid using this constructor as it is totally inefficient and reserved to spurious cases when the components have dots in names and this can happen if a task name contains dots	 
SATD	  todo bust up this hierarchy and compose using interfaces instead	 
SATD	  simulate a stuck worker there s probably a way to inject this failure	 
SATD	  todo this should be an outgoing variant of the component under test	 
SATD	  add an install task todo should probably not add this for all executables 	 
SATD	  todolptr why don t we check runningnodes here like we do in hasnodesremaining 	 
SATD	  dumb terminal doesn t support ansi control codes todo remove this when we use terminal rather than jansi to render to console	 
SATD	  this is a workaround for httpsgithubcomgradlegradleissues several early typed operations have buildpath property the value of which can only be determined after the settings file for the build has loaded the workaround is to buffer all operation notifications in memory until the root build s settings have loaded this works because all possible settings files have been evaluated by the time the root one has been this is not guaranteed to hold into the future a proper solution would be to change the operation detailsresults to be truly immutable and convey values known at the time	 
SATD	  an amount is an immutable value of some quantity such as duration or length each amount has a decimal value and associated units todo need to sort out scaling when dividing or converting between units 	 
SATD	  todo move this to propertyvalue instead

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  versions before would throw away the cause there was also a regression in x	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  this cannot be copyonwritearraylist because we need to iterate it in reverse which requires atomically getting an iterator and the size moreover we iterate this list far more often that we mutate making a albeit home grown copyonwrite strategy more appealing

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  legacy mode for internal apis	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  clear previous traversal state if any	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  notify threads that may be waiting on this task to complete this is required because although all builds may share the same coordination service the something may have changed event that is fired when a task in this build completes happens before the state tracked here is updated and so the worker threads in the consuming build may think the task has not completed and go back to sleep waiting for some other event to happen which may not signalling again here means that all worker threads in all builds will be woken up which can be expensive it would be much better to avoid duplicating the task state here and instead have the task executors communicate directly with each other possibly via some abstraction that represents the task outcome

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  only remove edges that come from a different node than the source of the dependency going back to pending the edges from the from will be removed first	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  coercion is an expensive process so we cache the result of coercing to other attribute types we can afford using a hashmap here because attributes are interned and their lifetime doesn t exceed a build

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  when deriving variants for the java ecosystem we actually have components mixed together the library and the platform and there s no way to figure out what was the intent when it was published so we derive variants but we also need to use generic java api and java runtime attributes instead of more precise java api jars and java runtime jars because of the platform aspect which aren t jars but something using java api jars for the library part and java api for the platform would lead to selection of the platform when we don t want them in other words in a single component we cannot mix precise usages with more generic ones

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  when the artifacts declared in a component are modified for publishing nameclassifierextension then the maven publication no longer represents the underlying java component instead of publishing incorrect metadata we fail any attempt to publish the module metadata in the long term we will likely prevent any modification of artifacts added from a component instead we will make it easier to modify the components produced by a project allowing the published metadata to accurately reflect the local component metadata 	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  sourceset has no access to configurations where we could ask for a lenient view this means we have to deal with possible dependency resolution issues here we catch and log the exceptions here so that the eclipse model can be generated even if there are unresolvable dependencies defined in the configuration we can probably do better by inspecting the runtime classpath and finding out which configurations are part of it and only traversing any extra file collections manually

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  note this method is on taskinternal	 
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  when an artifact is being published it is first checked whether it is available if a transport returns null then it is assumed that artifact does not exist if we throw an attempt to publish will fail altogether even if we use resourceexceptions getmissinguri

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  using a string instead of a plain id here might look strange but this turned out to be the fastest of several experiments including using moduleidentifier initial implementation using moduleidentifier through immutablemoduleidentifierfactory for interning using a level map by group then by name using an interned string for the cachedid interning turned out to cost as much as what we gain from faster checks in maps and none of them reached the performance of just using a good old string

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  remembers the unresolved dependency for later logging and also adds a fake file dependency with the file path pointing to the attempted component selector this shows up in the ide as a red flag in the dependencies view that s not the best usability and it also muddies the api contract because we disguise an unresolved dependency as a file dependency even though that file really doesn t exist instead when generating files on the command line the logged warning is enough when using the tooling api a dedicated unresolved dependency object would be better and could be shown in a notification the command line warning should probably be omitted in that case

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  caching involves distinct caches so that scripts with the same hash classpath do not get compiled twice first we look for a cache script which path hash matches this cache is invalidated when the compile classpath of the script changes then we look into the d cache for a generic script with the same hash that will be remapped to the script class name both caches can be closed directly after use because for if the script changes or its compile classpath changes a different directory will be used for if the script changes a different cache is used if the classpath changes the cache is invalidated but classes are remapped to anyway so never directly used

SATD	  groovy allows more characters than characterisvalidjavaidentifier would allow if we find a good way to encode special chars we could remove some of these checks	 
SATD	  todo this might not do enough or too much but it is a good start without spreading logic everywhere	 
SATD	  hack warning fragile todo find a better way

SATD	  todo includes excludes 	 
SATD	  cast with explicit weaker generics for now to keep jdk happy todo find better fix	 
SATD	  todo report multiple missing labels of the same name only once

SATD	  todo possibly check for linecol with values of or less	 
SATD	  todo this method should really return some kind of meta classnode representing the combination of all bounds the code here just picks something out to be able to proceed and is not actually correct	 
SATD	  note as per the class javadoc this class doesn t obey the normal equalshashcode contract the following field and method could assist some scenarios which required a similar sort of contract but between equals and the custom canonicalhashcode currently commented out since we haven t found a real need we will likely remove this commented out code if no usage is identified soon 	 
SATD	  represents genericstype name todo in order to distinguish genericstype with same namesee groovy we should add a property to keep the declaring class fixing groovy steps change the signature of constructor genericstypename to genericstypenamestring name classnode declaringclass try to fix all compilation errorsif genericstype has declaringclass property the step would be a bit easy to fix run all tests to see whether the change breaks anything if all tests pass congratulations but if some tests are broken try to debug and find why we should find a way to set declaring class for genericstype first it can be completed at the resolving phase 	 
SATD	  todo we should flag this when the path is created that this is a field not a prop try direct method

SATD	  fixme for now just save the first error should really roll a new message with all of the details	 
SATD	  should we use a finer grained lock than this 	 
SATD	  it s better to cache class instances by the source code gcl will load the unique class instance for the same source code and avoid occupying permanent areametaspace repeatedly	 
SATD	  is method object correct type 	 
SATD	  a little bit of paranoid checking here most drivers will throw batchupdateexception perhaps 	 
SATD	  todo after we should introspect the meta property and set editable to false if the property is read only	 
SATD	  todo replace with normal string p not needed	 
SATD	  todo should try with just a node as the child	 
SATD	  hack warning todo handle and when they occur within strings	 
SATD	  todo this method is very similar to statictypescheckingsupport extractgenericsconnections but operates on classnodes instead of genericstype	 
SATD	  todo set correct type here if setting type and a methodcall is the last expression in a method then the method will return null if the method itself is not void too in bytecode after call aconst null areturn	 
SATD	  todo handle the owner and delegate cases better for nested scenarios and potentially remove the need for the implicit this case	 
SATD	  logme do we ignore it or fail 	 
SATD	  the class dodgyclass has an incorrect modifier synchronized	 
SATD	  we can t have a specialized version of callobject because the dispatch logic in closuremetaclass is too complex 	 
SATD	  todo implement	 
SATD	  don t do this in static initializer because we may never be needed todo put this lineseparator property somewhere everyone can use it	 
SATD	  note as per the class javadoc this class doesn t obey the normal equalshashcode contract the following field and method could assist some scenarios which required a similar sort of contract but between fastequals and the custom fasthashcode currently commented out since we haven t found a real need we will likely remove this commented out code if no usage is identified soon 	 
SATD	  this should always be the case but adding a test is safer	 
SATD	  todo not sure why but groovyuiviewbasiccontentpane buildoutputarea classdoc is null	 
SATD	  todo the check for iswildcard should be replaced with a more complete check	 
SATD	  todo is it safe to remove this what was the original intention 	 
SATD	  todo is this needed so we can click through on default values override	 
SATD	  todo implement below ifwhen needed	 
SATD	  todo expose this for stream based stripping

SATD	  todo can stcv be made smarter to avoid this check 	 
SATD	  todo maybe use more specialized type here	 
SATD	  todo make this a method to be called from tupleconstructor xform add check for defaults 	 
SATD	  normally we would do the following handle methodhandlesdropargumentshandle classclass but because there is a bug in invokedynamic in all jdk versions maybe use unsafeensureclassinitialized	 
SATD	  todo this really should find best match or find all matches and complain about ambiguity if more than one todo handle getat with more than one parameter todo handle default getat methods on java interfaces	 
SATD	  is method name correct 	 
SATD	  compiler configuration p used to specify the debug output to print stacktraces in case something fails todo could probably be reused to specify the encoding of the files to load or other properties 	 
SATD	  todo the case of a noclassdeffounderror needs a bit more research a simple recompilation is not possible it seems the current class we are searching for is there so we should mark that somehow basically the missing class needs to be completely compiled before we can again search for the current name	 
SATD	  todo below will be deleted once we fix type checker to understand readonly map otherwise seen as map string serializable 	 
SATD	  groovy immutable is not compatible with compilestatic	 
SATD	  todo remove after putatsplice gets deleted	 
SATD	  todo in groovy use varargs 	 
SATD	  todo expose this for other usage scenarios eg stream based stripping 	 
SATD	  a better set of more complete tests of everything below is on the way 	 
SATD	  todo the visitor doesn t always take printstreams as constructor params could be a more reusable implementation than this	 
SATD	  todo remove this visit	 
SATD	  todo we might wanna only try to resolve the name if we are on the left hand side of an expression or before a dot 	 
SATD	  todo groovydoc doesn t parse this file as our javag doesn t handle this jdk syntax	 
SATD	  convenience hack try convert singlechar strings to ints	 
SATD	  not thread safe	 
SATD	  todo refactor pipe to be bitwise or	 
SATD	  implementation note there are several ways for the groovy compiler to report an unexpected eof perhaps this implementation misses some if you find another way please add it	 
SATD	  keep the same default source encoding with the one used by parseclassinputstream string todo should we use orgcodehausgroovycontrolcompilerconfigurationdefault source encoding instead 	 
SATD	  todo should we make proxygenerator singleton 	 
SATD	  todo this object can be constant	 
SATD	  here is a different implementation that uses getproperties i have left it commented out because it returns a slightly different list of properties ie it does not return privates i don t know what dump really should be doing although imo showing private fields is a nono 	 
SATD	  todo also check for phase after sourceunitgetphase but will be ignored anyway todo we should only copy those annotations with field target but haven t visited annotations and gathered target info at this phase so we can t do this return annotationistargetallowedannotationnodefield target instead just don t copy ourselves for now	 
SATD	  todo these fail because regexp literals are converted into string literals on the antlr ast	 
SATD	  todo remove this once we support declarations in the while condition

SATD	  todo cache these

SATD	  todojwagenleitner remove or fix in future release according to the spec getcontentencoding returns the contentencoding http header which typically carries values such as gzip or deflate and is not the character set encoding for compatibility in x this behavior is retained but should be removed or fixed parse charset from contenttype header in future releases see groovy and httpsgithubcomapachegroovypull 	 
SATD	  todo test if this is ok with new mop should be changed we don t want the exception being unwrapped if it is a illegalargumentexception but in the case it is for example a illegalthreadstateexception we want the unwrapping from the runtime note the reason we want unwrapping sometimes and sometimes not is that the method invocation tries to invoke the method with and then reacts with type transformation if the invocation failed here this is ok for illegalargumentexception but it is possible that a reflector will be used to execute the call and then an exception from inside the method is not wrapped in a invocationtargetexception and we will end here boolean setreason egetclass illegalargumentexceptionclass this instanceof orgcodehausgroovyreflectiongeneratedmetamethod return metaclasshelpercreateexceptiontextfailed to invoke method this object argumentarray e setreason

SATD	  todo create a writeonlyexception class 	 
SATD	  todo if our code can never access inspect in this way it would be better

SATD	  todo handle acc synthetic for enum method parameters 	 
SATD	  todo change this exception type	 
SATD	  by default use grapeivy todo metainfservices resolver 	 
SATD	  this is a limitation that must be removed in a future version we cannot check generic type arguments if there are default parameters 	 
SATD	  todo type inference on maps and lists if possible	 
SATD	  hack javastubgenerator could have snuck in a constructor we don t want	 
SATD	  todo apply right generics here

SATD	  todo illegalargumentexception for margincharlength or support string as marker 	 
SATD	  todo the spacing here is unusual	 
SATD	  should we check interfaces as well if so at what level 	 
SATD	  todo add generics support so this can be used for eahc	 
SATD	  since the calling code will push the type again we better remove it here	 
SATD	  cater for explicit href in eg see todo push this earlier 	 
SATD	  todo if rhs is variableslotloader already then skip crating a new one	 
SATD	  todo inner class nodes don t have a constructors field available	 
SATD	  frickin hack for some reason deleting a string at offset does not get done properly so first replace and remove after parsing	 
SATD	  note def not needed in parameter declarations but it is valid todo is it ok to strip out def from parameter declarations 	 
SATD	  todo get the type s of the expressions to specify the map type to map x if possible	 
SATD	  todo spacing is odd cf last space in class vs interface above	 
SATD	  todo july test fine however this parses but causes error in antlrparserplugin fails after parser	 
SATD	  todo expose this for stream based scenarios 	 
SATD	  todo this is the only area where this metaclass needs to do some interception because groovy s current metaclass uses hard coded references to the javalangreflectconstructor class so you can t simply inject constructor like you can do properties methods and fields when groovy s metaclassimpl is refactored we can fix this	 
SATD	  todo is there a better way to do this 	 
SATD	  todo fix if empty assertionwriter fails because source text is null	 
SATD	  todo this won t strictly be true when using list expansion in argument calls	 
SATD	  should always be the case but safe guard is better	 
SATD	  todo remove this method if possible by switchpoint usage	 
SATD	  are we a local variable it should not be an explicitly this qualified method call and the current class should have a possible method	 
SATD	  todo move somewhere else	 
SATD	  todo shouldn t these extensions be kept elsewhere what about compilerconfiguration this method probably shouldn t be in groovymain either	 
SATD	  should we make the following method private 	 
SATD	  fixme the warning message will npe with what i have 	 
SATD	  todo need returntypequalifiedtypename here	 
SATD	  fixme do we really want this to create a new object regardless the position for example not as first statement in a constructor thisfirst statement in constructor is handled by specialconstructorcallexpression	 
SATD	  todo order methods alphabetically implement compareto enough 	 
SATD	  todo performance would be better if we created a stringbuilder	 
SATD	  todo remove dupe with simplegroovytype	 
SATD	  todo more finals 	 
SATD	  ugly hack type definition ie int x	 
SATD	  groovy precompiled classes lose synthetic boolean todo fix earlier as per groovy then remove extra check here	 
SATD	  todo should we have some unified function like printwritercheckerror 	 
SATD	  todo check if this part is actually used	 
SATD	  todo above is not quite the spacing i would expect but good enough for now	 
SATD	  todo consider moving next two statements up a level ie have just one more widely invoked	 
SATD	  todo this should go away once we have proper tags	 
SATD	  todo we should check if we have the property with the metaclass instead of trycatch 	 
SATD	  todo shouldn t really be treating annotation fields as methods remove this hack	 
SATD	  todo intern types todo configureast

SATD	  fixme what should we use as the base uri it is unlikely we get to this point with a relative uri since making a url from will make it absolute i think but lets handle the simple case of using file paths and turning that into an absolute file uri so we will use the current working directory as the base	 
SATD	  todo the following is legal java but pretty strange fails after parser	 
SATD	  todo should this really be static cleared on build to be safe	 
SATD	  todo validate args 	 
SATD	  todo joche replace with real implementation	 
SATD	  shall we allow this using boolean ctors is usually not what user wants	 
SATD	  groovy we d like stricter checking here but many drivers currently in use just aren t consistent enough so we log	 
SATD	  create one script per socket connection this is purposefully not caching the script so that the script source file can be changed on the fly as each connection is made to the server fixme groovy has other mechanisms specifically for watching to see if source code changes we should probably be using that here see also the comment about the fact we recompile a script that can t change	 
SATD	  todo test newlines inside strings somehow	 
SATD	  todo maybe use more special type stringbuffer here	 
SATD	  other internal error perhaps syntax 	 
SATD	  currently leaving biginteger and bigdecimal in list but see httpbugssuncombugdatabaseview bugdo bug id also color is not final so while not normally used with child classes it isn t strictly immutable use at your own risk this list can by extended by providing known immutable classes via immutableknownimmutableclasses 	 
SATD	  todo incomplete as body of dowhile should be executed at least once which this doesn t provide	 
SATD	  we found multiple matching methods this is a problem because we can use only one if it is a getter then use the most general return type to decide which method to use if it is a setter	 
SATD	  todo replace with a real fast path unary expression helper when available	 
SATD	  todo if we would know exactly which paths require the exceptions and which paths not we can sometimes save this guard	 
SATD	  todo blackdrag this if branch needs a rework there should be no direct method calls be produced the handling of thissuper could be much simplified see visitattributeexpression the field accessibility check could be moved directly into the search which would also no longer require the groovybugerror then the outer class field access seems to be without any tests if there are tests for that then the code here is dead code	 
SATD	  todo don t allow override 	 
SATD	  todo need process multi	 
SATD	  does this operator make any sense 	 
SATD	  todo we should use the real josh bloch algorithm here 	 
SATD	  we have a duplicate class one possibility for this is that we declared a script and a class in the same file and named the class like the file	 
SATD	  todo there is no compileunit in scope so class name checking won t work but that mostly affects the bytecode generation rather than viewing the ast 	 
SATD	  todo maybe a double dispatch thing to handle new large numbers

SATD	  todo implement int operations for this	 
SATD	  todo should be able to remove the klazz field once becomes the mainline release gradle has a cleanup mechanism in place to reflectively access this klazz field the klazz field is being kept for compatibility so as to not break builds that depend on versions of groovy after the field was changed to a weakreference classref it appears that gradle only performs the cleanup when it detects a groovy version of x so the klazz field and placeholder sentinel class can likely be safely removed once the release version bumps to or beyond see httpsgithubcomgradlegradleblob f subprojectscoresrcmainjavaorggradleapiinternalclassloadingleakyonjava groovysystemloaderjava l

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	  the basic strategy is an optimisticstyle scheme based on the guarantee that the hash table and its lists are always kept in a consistent enough state to be read without locking read operations first proceed without locking by traversing the apparently correct list of the apparently correct bin if an entry is found but not invalidated value field null it is returned if not found operations must recheck after a memory barrier to make sure they are using both the right list and the right table which can change under resizes if invalidated reads must acquire main update lock to wait out the update and then retraverse all list additions are at the front of each bin making it easy to check changes and also fast to traverse entry next pointers are never assigned remove builds new nodes when necessary to preserve this remove also clear invalidates removed nodes to alert read operations that they must wait out the full modifications

SATD	  todo this does not work correctly none of the partitions is created but the folder for the first two is created it is because in hivemetastoreadd partitions core when going through the partitions the first two are already put and started in the thread pool when the exception occurs in the third one when the exception occurs we go to the finally part but the map can be empty it depends on the progress of the other threads so the folders won t be deleted assertasserttruemetastoreispathexistsnew pathpartition getsdgetlocation assertasserttruemetastoreispathexistsnew pathpartition getsdgetlocation assertasserttruemetastoreispathexistsnew pathpartition getsdgetlocation	 
SATD	  note we assume that this isn t an already malformed query we don t check for that here it will fail later anyway	 
SATD	  todo not clear if we should cache these or not for now don t bother	 
SATD	  todo this needs to be removed see testreplicationscenarios comments	 
SATD	  bug this will not work in remote mode hive 	 
SATD	  todo change this method to make the output easier to parse parse programmatically	 
SATD	  todo remove 	 
SATD	  wouldn t it make more sense to return the first element of the list returned by the previous call 	 
SATD	  a better logic would be to find the alias	 
SATD	  we need to enforce the size here even the types are the same	 
SATD	  this method may not be safe as it can throw an npe if a key or value is null	 
SATD	  todo this is an ugly hack because tez plugin isolation does not make sense for llap plugins we are going to register a threadlocal here for now so that the scheduler initializing in the same thread after the communicator will pick up or the other way around	 
SATD	  todo mssplit uncomment once we move eventmessage over	 
SATD	  follow hive s rules for type inference as oppose to calcite s for return type todo perhaps we should do this for all functions not just 	 
SATD	  todo hive while getting stats from metastore we currently only get one col at a time this could be improved get all necessary columns in advance then use local todo hive aggregations could be done directly in metastore hive over mysql

SATD	  todo both of these are texception why do we need these separate clauses 	 
SATD	  todo if two hs s start at exactly the same time which could happen during a coordinated restart they could start generating the same ids should we store the starttime	 
SATD	  todo given the specific data and lookups perhaps the nested thing should not be a map in fact cslm has slow singlethreaded operation and one file is probably often read by just one or few threads so a much more simple ds with locking might be better let s use cslm for now since it s available	 
SATD	  todo ideally this should be done independent of whether mr is setup or not	 
SATD	  this is not modeled as a before because it needs to be parameterized pertest if there is a better way to do this we should do it	 
SATD	  todo hive 	 
SATD	  make sure nullvalued confvar properties do not override the hadoop configuration note comment out the following test case for now until a better way to test is found as this test case cannot be reliably tested the reason for this is that hive does overwrite fsdefaultname in hiveconf if the property is set in system properties checkhadoopconfconfvarshadoopfsvarname coresitexml checkconfvarconfvarshadoopfs null checkhiveconfconfvarshadoopfsvarname coresitexml

SATD	  todo change all this to be based on a regular interface instead of relying on the proto service exception signatures cannot be controlled without this for the moment	 
SATD	  policychangelistener will be implemented later	 
SATD	  todo do we actually need this reader the caller just extracts child readers	 
SATD	  todo hive what is mergework and why is it not part of the regular operator chain the mergemapopinitialize call further down can block and will not receive information about an abort request	 
SATD	  todo hive handle cases where nodes go down and come back on the same port historic information	 
SATD	  todo most protocol exceptions are probably unrecoverable throw 	 
SATD	  todo do we also need to remove the mapjoin from the list of rs s children 	 
SATD	  todo why is there a tezsession in mr execdriver 	 
SATD	  replace insert overwrite by merge equivalent rewriting here we need to do this complex ast rewriting that generates the same plan that a merge clause would generate because cbo does not support merge yet todo support merge as first class member in cbo to simplify this logic	 
SATD	  todo current implementation of replication will result in drop partition under replication scope being called perpartition instead of multiple partitions however to be robust we must still handle the case of multiple partitions in case this assumption changes in the future however if this assumption changes we will not be very performant if we fetch each partition onebyone and then decide on inspection whether or not this is a candidate for dropping thus we need a way to push this filter replicationspecalloweventreplacementinto to the metastore to allow it to do drop a partition or not depending on a predicate on the parameter key values	 
SATD	  todo should we pass curr instead of null 	 
SATD	  really not sure if this should go here will have to see how the storage mechanism evolves

SATD	  todo remove this constructor	 
SATD	  todo add the ability to extractfiletail to read from multiple buffers 	 
SATD	  todo instead of simply restricting by message format we should eventually move to a jdbcdriverstype registering of message format and picking message factory per event to decode for now however since all messages have the same factory restricting by message format is effectively a guard against older leftover data that would cause us problems	 
SATD	  todo when hive moves to java make updatetimezone as default method in

SATD	  todo cat i am fairly certain that most calls to this are in error this should only be used when the database location is unset which should never happen except when a new database is being created once i have confirmation of this change calls of this to getdatabasepath since it does the right thing also merge this with determinedatabasepath as it duplicates much of the logic	 
SATD	  todo should this be the concern of the mutator 	 
SATD	  todo provide support for reporting errors this should never happen as server always returns a valid status on success	 
SATD	  todo ideally when the splits udf is made a proper api coordinator should not be managed as a global hs should create it and then pass it around

SATD	  note that this logic may drop some of the tables of the database even if the drop database fail for any reason todo fix this	 
SATD	  some walkers extending defaultgraphwalker eg forwardwalker do not use opqueue and rely uniquely in the towalk structure thus we store the results produced by the dispatcher here todo rewriting the logic of those walkers to use opqueue	 
SATD	  this is a corner case where we have an extract of time unit like daymonth pushed as extraction fn todo the best way to fix this is to add explicit output druid types to calcite extraction functions impls	 
SATD	  workaround for hadoop remove when hadoop x is no longer supported	 
SATD	  we could pass in the number of nodes that we expect instead of also a single concurrent request per node is currently hardcoded	 
SATD	  todo strangely the default parametrization is to ignore missing tables	 
SATD	  fixme should clean up test path but not doing it now for debugging s sake	 
SATD	  this will throw error if we close pout early	 
SATD	  it is not a very clean way and should be modified later due to compatibility reasons user sees the results as json for custom scripts and has no way for specifying that right now it is hardcoded in the code	 
SATD	  todo this test passes fine locally but fails on linux not sure why	 
SATD	  todo seekableinputstreamreadfully eventually calls a hadoop method that used to be buggy in and also anyway just does a copy for a direct buffer do a copy here seekableinputstreamstreamreadfullybb

SATD	  set footer cache for current split generation see field comment not thread safe	 
SATD	  todo the below seem like they should just be combined into partitiondesc	 
SATD	  callablewithndc inherits from ndc only when call is invoked callablewithndc has to extended to provide access to its ndcstack that is cloned during creation until then we will use reflection to access the private field fixme hive follow to remove this reflection	 
SATD	  todo this is brittle who said everyone has to upgrade using upgrade process 	 
SATD	  check whether a task can run to completion or may end up blocking on it s sources this currently happens via looking up source state todo eventually this should lookup the hive processor to figure out whether it s reached a state where it can finish especially in cases of failures after data has been fetched return true if the task can finish false otherwise 	 
SATD	  undone how to look for all nulls in a multikey let nulls through for now	 
SATD	  note this can still conflict with parallel transactions we do not currently handle parallel changes from two admins by design 	 
SATD	  todo time good enough for now we ll likely improve this we may also work in something the equivalent of pid thrid and move to nanos to ensure uniqueness

SATD	  get rid of tok selexpr	 
SATD	  clear the work map after build todo remove caching instead 	 
SATD	  do not update stats is supposed to be a transient parameter that is only passed via rpc we want to avoid this property from being persistent note if this property is set as table property we will remove it which is incorrect but we can t distinguish between these two cases this problem was introduced by hive a better approach would be to pass the property	 
SATD	  this is using the payload from the rootvertexinitializer corresponding to inputname ideally it should be using it s own configuration class but that

SATD	  todo simple wrap rethrow for now clean up with error codes	 
SATD	  todo add method to only get current ie skip history more efficient	 
SATD	  simple wrapper of object with objectinspector todo we need to redefine the hashcode and equals methods so that it can be put into a hashmap as a key this class also serves as a facility for a function that returns both an object and an objectinspector 	 
SATD	  the ordering of types here is used to determine which numeric types are commonconvertible to one another probably better to rely on the ordering explicitly defined here than to assume that the enum values that were arbitrarily assigned in primitivecategory work for our purposes	 
SATD	  something else is wrong	 
SATD	  todo comments in rexshuttlevisitcall mention other types in this category need to resolve those together and preferably in the base class rexshuttle	 
SATD	  todo verify if this is needed why can t it be always nullempty	 
SATD	  is the outer join that we saw most recently is a right outer join 	 
SATD	  todo this relies on hdfs not changing the format we assume if we could get inode id this is still going to work otherwise file ids can be turned off later we should use as public utility method in hdfs to obtain the inodebased path	 
SATD	  todo should it rather do a prefix 	 
SATD	  todo this method is temporary ideally hive should only need to pass to tez the amount of memory it requires to do the map join and tez should take care of figuring out how much to allocate adjust the percentage of memory to be reserved for the processor from tez based on the actual requested memory by the map join ie hiveconvertjoinnoconditionaltaskthreshold return the adjusted percentage 	 
SATD	  a hack to verify that authorization check passed exception can be thrown be cause the functions are not being called with valid params verify that exception has come from objectstore code which means that the

SATD	  todo move this to calcite	 
SATD	  todo add this to metadatareader in orc si metadata buffer not just metadata	 
SATD	  todo this should come from type system currently there is no definition	 
SATD	  todo at the moment there s no way of knowing whether a query is running or not a race is possible between dagcomplete and registerfragment where the registerfragment is processed after a dagcompletes may need to keep track of completed dags for a certain time duration to avoid this alternately send in an explicit dag start message before any other message is processed multiple threads communicating from a single am gets in the way of this	 
SATD	  should we allow writing to nontransactional tables in an explicit transaction the user may issue rollback but these tables won t rollback can do this by checking readentitywriteentity to determine whether it s readingwriting any non acid and raise an appropriate error driveracidsinks and drivertransactionalinquery can be used if any acid is in the query 	 
SATD	  todo implement 	 
SATD	  todo what is this checking 	 
SATD	  i think this is wrong the drop table statement should come on the table topic not the db topic alan

SATD	  todo convert genincludedcolumns and setsearchargument to use typedescription	 
SATD	  todo when this code is a little less hot change most logs to debug we will determine what to do under lock and then do stuff outside of the lock the approach is statebased we consider the task to have a duck when we have decided to give it one the sends below merely fix the discrepancy with the actual state we may add the ability to wait for llaps to positively ack the revokes in future the procedural approach requires that we track the ducks traveling on network concurrent terminations etc so while more precise it s much more complex

SATD	  note this is redundant with types	 
SATD	  the following lines are exactly what mysql does todo why do we do this 	 
SATD	  temporary variable for testing this is added just to turn off this feature in case of a bug in deployment it has not been documented in hivedefaultxml intentionally this should be removed	 
SATD	  todo need session handle	 
SATD	  this is kind of hacky the read entity contains the old table whereas the write entity contains the new table this is needed for rename both the old and the new table names are passed	 
SATD	  undone for now don t add more small keys	 
SATD	  todo can this ever happen 	 
SATD	  todo there s a potential problem here if some table uses external schema like avro with a very large type name it seems like the view does not derive the serde from the table so it won t be able to just get the type from the deserializer like the table does we won t be able to properly store the type in the rdbms metastore	 
SATD	  todo this should depends on input format and be in a map or something	 
SATD	  todo we can actually consider storing all the delta encoded row offsets not a lot of overhead compared to the data itself and with row offsets we could use columnar blocks for inconsistent splits we are not optimizing for inconsistent splits for now	 
SATD	  todo should this just use physical ids 	 
SATD	  todo wtf why is this in this method this has nothing to do with anything	 
SATD	  this class isn t used and i suspect does totally the wrong thing it s only here so that i can provide some output format to the tables and partitions i create i actually write to	 
SATD	  todo does arg need type cast

SATD	  builder for relational expressions todo note that this is copied from calcite s relbulder because calcite hasn t been fixed yet this should be deleted and replaced with relbuilder in subqueryremoverule once calcite is fixed edit although calcite has been fixed and released but hive now has special handling in join it gets a flag to see if semi join is to be created or not so we still can not replace this with calcite s relbuilder p code relbuilder does not make possible anything that you could not also accomplish by calling the factory methods of the particular relational expression but it makes common tasks more straightforward and concise p code relbuilder uses factories to create relational expressions by default it uses the default factories which create logical relational expressions link orgapachecalciterellogicallogicalfilter link orgapachecalciterellogicallogicalproject and so forth but you could override those factories so that say code filter creates instead a code hivefilter p it is not threadsafe

SATD	  note this is a little bit confusing the special treatment of stripelevel buffers is because we run the columnstreamdata refcount one ahead as specified above it may look like this would release the buffers too many times one release from the consumer one from releaseinitialrefcounts below and one here however this is merely handling a special case where all the batches that are sharing the stripe level stream have been processed before we got here they have all decrefed the csd but have not released the buffers because of that extra refcount so this is essentially the consumer refcount being released here	 
SATD	  this doesn t always work since some jdbc drivers eg oracle s return a blank string from gettablename	 
SATD	  todo can this be moved out of the main callback path	 
SATD	  todo add more expected test result here	 
SATD	  todo mssplit for now we have construct this by reflection because imetastoreclient can t be moved until after hivemetastore is moved which can t be moved until this is moved	 
SATD	  todo need a test where we actually have more than file	 
SATD	  here comes the ugly part	 
SATD	  to be removed in hive 	 
SATD	  optimization for later	 
SATD	  is there a way to provide char length here it might actually be ok as long as there is an object inspector with char length receiving this value	 
SATD	  this command exists solely to output this message todo can we do it wo an error 	 
SATD	  todo add support for and clauses under or clauses firstcut takes a known minimal tree and no others expr a a or a a in expr and 	 
SATD	  todo set this up as a tree instead of a flat list	 
SATD	  operator factory for predicate pushdown processing of operator graph each operator determines the pushdown predicates by walking the expression tree each operator merges its own pushdown predicates with those of its children finally the tablescan operator gathers all the predicates and inserts a filter operator after itself todo further optimizations multiinsert case create a filter operator for those predicates that couldn t be pushed to the previous operators in the data flow merge multiple sequential filter predicates into so that plans are more readable remove predicates from filter operators that have been pushed currently these pushed predicates are evaluated twice 	 
SATD	  hive call currently ineffective	 
SATD	  note no location check the buffer is always locked for move here	 
SATD	  todo mssplit for now if we cannot load the default partitionexpressionformetastore class since it s from ql load the defaultpartitionexpressionproxy which just throws unsupportedoperationexceptions this allows existing hive instances to work but also allows us to instantiate the metastore stand alone for testing not sure if this is the best long term solution	 
SATD	  todo this is very brittle given that hive supports nested directories in the tables the caller should pass a flag explicitly telling us if the directories in the input are data or parent of data for now retain this for backward compat	 
SATD	  todo these appear to always be called under write lock do they need sync 	 
SATD	  todo we could perhaps reuse the same directory for hiveresources 	 
SATD	  if there s a mismatch between static and object name or a mismatch between vector and nonvector operator name the optimizer doens t work correctly 	 
SATD	  not really sure how to refer to this or if we can todo we could find a different from branch for the union that might have an alias or we could add an alias here to refer to but that might break other branches	 
SATD	  todo instantiating fs objects are generally costly refactor	 
SATD	  todo when pb is upgraded to newinstancebytebuffer method should be used here	 
SATD	  all the code paths below propagate nulls even if neither arg nor arg have nulls this is to reduce the number of code paths and shorten the code at the expense of maybe doing unnecessary work if neither input has nulls this could be improved in the future by expanding the number of code paths 	 
SATD	  deprecated in favour of link hcatpartition getpartitionkeyvalmap to be removed in hive 	 
SATD	  todo remove this once calcite filterprojecttransposerule can take rule operand	 
SATD	  todo we could fall back to trying one by one and only ignore the failed ones	 
SATD	  deprecated in favour of link hcattable getstoragehandler to be removed in hive 	 
SATD	  first try temp table todo cat i think the right thing here is to always put temp tables in the current catalog but we don t yet have a notion of current catalog so we ll have to hold on until we do	 
SATD	  todo set other table properties as needed	 
SATD	  don t pass in the pool set not thread safe if the user is trying to force us to use a nonexistent pool we want to fail anyway we will fail later during get	 
SATD	  todo since operationlog is moved to package oahhqlsession we may add a enum there and map fetchorientation to it	 
SATD	  todo ideally this only needs to be called if the result type will also change however since that requires support from type inference rules to tell whether a rule decides return type based on input types for now all operators will be recreated with new type if any operand changed unless the operator has builtin type	 
SATD	  todo ideally we should store shortened representation of only the necessary fields in hbase it will probably require custom sarg application code	 
SATD	  this is a massive hack the compactor threads have to access packages in ql such as acidinputformat ql depends on metastore so we can t directly access those to deal with this the compactor thread classes have been put in ql and they are instantiated here dyanmically this is not ideal but it avoids a massive refactoring of hive packages wrap the start of the threads in a catch throwable loop so that any failures don t doom the rest of the metastore	 
SATD	  fixme there were afterclass methodsi guess this is the right ordermaybe not	 
SATD	  todo hive get all of these properties from the registry this will need to take care of different instances publishing potentially different values when we support changing configurations dynamically	 
SATD	  todo replace with withtimeout after we get the relevant guava upgrade	 
SATD	  todo need to turn on rules that s commented out and add more if necessary 	 
SATD	  todo handle renaming files somewhere 	 
SATD	  deprecated in favour of link hcattable getbucketcols to be removed in hive 	 
SATD	  todo this doesn t include superclass	 
SATD	  fixme move this to colstat related part	 
SATD	  todo not sure that this is the correct behavior it doesn t make sense to create the partition without column info this should be investigated later	 
SATD	  note preservepartitionspecstrue implies inherittablespecsfalse but but preservepartitionspecsfalsedefault here is not sufficient enough info to set inherittablespecstrue	 
SATD	  fixme this should be changeto valueof that will also kill that fallback none which is i think more like a problem than a feature 	 
SATD	  todo setup a set of threads to process incoming requests make sure requests for a single dagquery are handled by the same thread	 
SATD	  todo add alter database support in hcat	 
SATD	  todo add tests for partitions in other catalogs	 
SATD	  todo i suspect we could skip much of the stuff above this in the function in the case of update and delete but i don t understand all of the side effects of the above code and don t want to skip over it yet	 
SATD	  todo expireafteraccess locks cache segments on put and expired get it doesn t look too bad but if we find some perf issues it might be a good idea to remove this we are probably not caching that many constructors note that weakkeys causes to be used for key compare this will only work for classes in the same classloader should be ok in this case	 
SATD	  todo why is the queue name set again it has already been setup via setqueuename do only one of the two	 
SATD	  todo create and init session sets up queue isdefault but does not initialize the configuration	 
SATD	  deprecated in favour of link hcattable sortcolsmap string string to be removed in hive 	 
SATD	  todo handle query hints currently we ignore them	 
SATD	  todo currently we only support equal operator on two references we might extend the logic to support other orderpreserving udfs here	 
SATD	  is the right was at the left side of a right outer join 	 
SATD	  todo why does this only kill nondefault sessions nothing for workload management since that only deals with default ones	 
SATD	  todo should this use getpartitiondescfrompathrecursively that s what other code uses	 
SATD	  todo fix this	 
SATD	  fixme doing the multiline handling down here means higherlevel logic never sees the extra lines so for example if a script is being saved it won t include the continuation lines this is logged as sfnet bug 	 
SATD	  review jhyde oct this rule is nonstatic depends on the state of members in reldecorrelator and has sideeffects in the decorrelator this breaks the contract of a planner rule and the rule will not be reusable in other planners	 
SATD	  we can loop thru all the tables to check if they are acid first and then perform cleanup but it s more efficient to unconditionally perform cleanup for the database especially when there are a lot of tables	 
SATD	  todo implement this	 
SATD	  todo allow using unsafe optionally bounds check first to trigger bugs whether the first byte matches or not	 
SATD	  todo this doesn t appear to be used anywhere	 
SATD	  for auto convert mapjoins it not safe to dedup in here todo	 
SATD	  we re scanning a tree from roots to leaf this is not technically correct demux and mux operators might form a diamond shape but we will only scan one path and ignore the others because the diamond shape is always contained in a single vertex the scan is depth first and because we remove parents when we pack a pipeline into a vertex we will never visit any node twice but because of that we might have a situation where we need to connect work that comes after the work we re currently looking at also note the concept of leaf and root is reversed in hive for historical	 
SATD	  the following parameters are not supported yet todo add support	 
SATD	  todo this should be unique	 
SATD	  todo concurrent insertupdate of same partition should pass	 
SATD	  deprecated in favour of link hcattable fieldsterminatedby to be removed in hive 	 
SATD	  todo this is invalid for acid tables and we cannot access acidutils here	 
SATD	  after each major compaction stats need to be updated on each column of the tablepartition which previously had stats create a bucketed orc backed table orc is currently required by acid populate partitions with data compute stats insert some data into the table using streamingapi trigger major compaction which should update stats check that stats have been updated throws exception todo add nonpartitioned test add a test with sorted table 	 
SATD	  in hive delta file names changed to delta xxxx yyyy zzzz prior to that the name was delta xxxx yyyy we want to run compaction tests such that both formats are used since new code has to be able to read old files 	 
SATD	  todo should call hivehfileoutputformat setoutputpath	 
SATD	  todo we could try to get superclass or generic interfaces	 
SATD	  todo this actually calls the metrics system and getmetrics that may be expensive for now it looks like it should be ok to do on wm thread	 
SATD	  todo get rid of the builders they serve no purpose just call ctors directly	 
SATD	  todo verify gb having is not a separate filter if so we shouldn t introduce derived table	 
SATD	  q why don t we lock the snapshot here instead of having client make an explicit call whenever it chooses a if we want to rely on locks for transaction scheduling we must get the snapshot after lock acquisition relying on locks is a pessimistic strategy which works better under high contention 	 
SATD	  todo temporary need to expose from orc utils note the difference in null checks	 
SATD	  todo maybe use stack of est obj pairs instead of recursion	 
SATD	  todo shortcut for last col below length 	 
SATD	  temporary in order to avoid a new version of storageapi do the conversion here	 
SATD	  todo these constraints should be supported for partition columns	 
SATD	  we have a nested setcolref process that and start from scratch todo use stack 	 
SATD	  todo is this correct based on the same logic as hive 	 
SATD	  todo refactor the following into the pipeline	 
SATD	  todo change to fileinputformat field after mapreduce 	 
SATD	  todo if we ever use this endpoint for anything else refactor cycling into a separate class	 
SATD	  something is seriously wrong if this is happening	 
SATD	  todo ordering seems to affect the distinctness needs checking disabling	 
SATD	  todo avoid put by working directly in outstream 	 
SATD	  can t fetch prefix on colqual must pull the entire qualifier todo use an iterator to do the filter serverside	 
SATD	  these tests inherently cause exceptions to be written to the test output logs this is undesirable since you it might appear to someone looking at the test output logs as if something is failing when it isn t not sure	 
SATD	  return hiveconfgetpositionfrominternalnamefieldname the above line should have been all the implementation that we need but due to a bug in that impl which recognizes only singledigit columns we need another impl here	 
SATD	  deprecated in favour of link hcattable getpartcols to be removed in hive 	 
SATD	  todo verify if we need to use constantobjectinspector to unwrap data	 
SATD	  generate hivetablefunctionscan relnode for lateral view todo support different functions not only inline with lateral view join	 
SATD	  todo this is actually not adding anything since lockcomponent uses a trie to promote a lock except by accident when we have a partitioned target table we have a readentity and writeentity for the table so we mark readentity and then delete writeentity replace with partition entries so dbtxnmanager skips read lock on the readentity inputnolockneeded 	 
SATD	  todo cleanup once parquet support timestamp type annotation	 
SATD	  todo buffers are accounted for at allocation time but ideally we should report the memory overhead from the java objects to memory manager and remove it when discarding file	 
SATD	  todo cleanup this	 
SATD	  todo hive do we need maxlength checking 	 
SATD	  in addbatchtowriter we have passed the batch to both orc and operator pipeline neither ever changes the vectors we d need a set of vectors batch to write to todo for now create this from scratch ideally we should return the vectors from ops we could also have the orc thread create it for us in its spare time	 
SATD	  todo enforce max length	 
SATD	  todo would it make sense to return buffers asynchronously 	 
SATD	  todo the best solution is to support nan in expression reduction	 
SATD	  todo ideally this should be moved outside to hivemetastore to be shared between all the rawstores right now there s no method to create a pool	 
SATD	  todo hive abort handling	 
SATD	  todo update to search by id once hive is done	 
SATD	  note type param is not available here

SATD	  todo change this over to just store local dir indices instead of the entire path far more efficient	 
SATD	  todo we might revisit this in createdroprecreate cases needs some thinking on	 
SATD	  todo why is this in text formatter 	 
SATD	  note this rule is replicated from calcite s subqueryremoverule transform that converts in exists and scalar subqueries into joins todo reason this is replicated instead of using calcite s is calcite creates null literal with null type but hive needs it to be properly typed p subqueries are represented by link rexsubquery expressions p a subquery may or may not be correlated if a subquery is correlated the wrapped link relnode will contain a link rexcorrelvariable before the rewrite and the product of the rewrite will be a link correlate the correlate can be removed using link reldecorrelator 	 
SATD	  truncate todo posix fallocate 	 
SATD	  note this code tries to get all keyvalue pairs out of the map it s not very efficient the more efficient way should be to let mapoi return an iterator this is currently not supported by mapoi yet	 
SATD	  undone why do we need to specify binarysortableserde explicitly here 	 
SATD	  todo last param is bogus why is this hardcoded 	 
SATD	  todo move this to a common method note this gets ids by name so we assume indices don t need to be adjusted for acid	 
SATD	  decorrelaterexshuttle ends up decorrelating expressions corcol to if value generator is not generated is further simplified to false this is wrong and messes up the whole tree to prevent this visitcall is overridden to rewritesimply such predicates to is not null we also need to take care that we do this only for correlated predicates and not user specified explicit predicates todo this code should be removed once calcite is fixed and there is support of not equal

SATD	  todo separate model is needed for compressedoops which can be guessed from memory size	 
SATD	  todo should we convert multijoin to be a child of hivejoin	 
SATD	  todo should be doing security check here users should not be able to see each other s locks	 
SATD	  we do no handle anything but ok for now again we need a real client for this api todo handle and return a new connection nothing for now	 
SATD	  todo close basically resets the object to a bunch of nulls we should ideally not reuse the object because it s pointless and errorprone

SATD	  todo change this to not serialize the entire configuration minor	 
SATD	  todo for object inspector fields assigning kb for now to better estimate the memory size every object inspectors have to implement memoryestimate interface which is a lot of change with little benefit compared	 
SATD	  undone add support for date timestamp interval year month interval day time	 
SATD	  todo there was code here to create guessestimate for collection wrt how usage changes when removing elements however it s too errorprone for anything involving preallocated capacity so it was discarded	 
SATD	  extract the buckedid from pathfilesmap this is more accurate method however it may not work in certain cases where buckets are named after files used while loading data in such case fallback to old potential inaccurate method the accepted file names are such as copy 	 
SATD	  this is a bit hackish to fix mismatch between sarg and hive types for timestamp and date todo move those types to storageapi	 
SATD	  todo hive move to using a loop and a timed wait once tez is fixed	 
SATD	  todo add a configurable option to skip the history and just drop it 	 
SATD	  todo refactor this into an utility llap tests use this pattern a lot	 
SATD	  todo make aliases unique otherwise needless rewriting takes place	 
SATD	  derive additional attributes to be rendered by explain todo this method is relied upon by custom input formats to set jobconf properties this is madness this is hive storage handlers 	 
SATD	  connects to the link imetastoreclient meta store that will be used to manage link transaction lifecycles also checks that the tables destined to receive mutation events are able to do so the client should only hold one open transaction at any given time todo enforce this 	 
SATD	  todo this should have an option for directory to inherit from the parent table including bucketing and list bucketing for the use in compaction when the latter runs inside a transaction	 
SATD	  undone parameterize for implementation variation 	 
SATD	  todo ifexists could be moved to metastore in fact it already supports that check it for now since we get parts for output anyway so we can get the error message earlier if we get rid of output we can get rid of this	 
SATD	  fixme moved default value to herefor now i think this features is never really used from the command line	 
SATD	  todo should be moved out	 
SATD	  todo types need to be checked

SATD	  todo ugly hack because java doesn t have dtors and tez input hangs on shutdown	 
SATD	  todo make script output prefixing configurable had to disable this since it results in lots of test diffs	 
SATD	  todo also support filekey in splits like orcsplit does	 
SATD	  todo when txn stats are implemented use writeids to determine stats accuracy	 
SATD	  hive is pretty simple read stupid in writing out values via the serializer we re just going to go through matching indices hive formats normally handle mismatches with null we don t have that option so instead we ll end up throwing an exception for invalid records	 
SATD	  todo handle negations	 
SATD	  todo handle task to container map events in case of hard failures	 
SATD	  todo partition names in getpartitionsbynames are not case insensitive	 
SATD	  todo this should be configured in serde	 
SATD	  todo have to put in the support for as clause	 
SATD	  ideally we should use hiverelnode convention however since volcano planner throws in that case because druidquery does not implement the interface we set it as bindable currently we do not use convention in hive hence that should be fine todo if we want to make use of convention eg while directly generating operator tree instead of ast this should be changed	 
SATD	  call getsplit on the inputformat create an hcatsplit for each underlying split when the desired number of input splits is missing use a default number denoted by zero todomalewicz currently each partition is split independently into a desired number however we want the union of all partitions to be split into a desired number while maintaining balanced sizes of input

SATD	  todo allow port per host 	 
SATD	  note this is for generating the internal path name for partitions users should always use the metastore api to get the path name for a partition users should not directly take partition values and turn it into a path name by themselves because the logic below may change in the future in the future it s ok to add new chars to the escape list and old data won t be corrupt because the full path name in metastore is stored in that case hive will continue to read the old data but when it creates new partitions it will use new names edit there are some use cases for which adding new chars does not seem to be backward compatible eg if partition was created with name having a special char that you want to start escaping and then you try dropping the partition with a hive version that now escapes the special char using the list below then the drop partition fails to work	 
SATD	  todo can we be more precise than stringstring 	 
SATD	  todo this is wrong this test sets up dummy txn manager and so it cannot create acid tables if i change it to use proper txn manager the setup for some tests hangs this used to work by accident now this works due a test flag the test needs to be fixed create table	 
SATD	  todo currently no way to test alter partition as hcatclient doesn t support it	 
SATD	  note some of these scenarios could be handled but they are not supported right now the reason is that we bind a query to appuser using the signed token information and we don t want to bother figuring out which one to use in case of ambiguity wo a use case ambiguous user ambiguous user ambiguous user ambiguous app	 
SATD	  only support bulkload when a hfilefamilypath has been specified todo support detecting cf s from column mapping todo support loading into multiple cf s at a time

SATD	  there s full hash code stored in front of the key we could check that first if keylength is it obviously doesn t make sense less bytes to check in a key then if there s a match we check it in vain but what is the proportion of matches for writes it could be if all keys are unique for reads we hope it s really high then if there s a mismatch what probability is there that key mismatches in bytes so just checking the key is faster 	 
SATD	  given a rexcall tablescan find max no of nulls currently it picks the col with max no of nulls todo improve this param call param t return 	 
SATD	  note beelineopts uses reflector in an extensive way to call getters and setters on itself if you want to add any getters or setters to this class but not have it interfere with saved variables in beelineproperties careful use of this marker is needed also possible to get this by naming these functions obtainblah instead of getblah and so on but that is not explicit and will likely surprise people looking at the code in the future better to be explicit in intent

SATD	  todo note that the token is not renewable right now and will last for weeks by default	 
SATD	  todo should this be also top down 	 
SATD	  todo most of the code in this class is ripped from zookeeper tests instead of redoing it we should contribute updates to their code which let us more easily access testing helper objects xxx copied from the only used class by qtestutil from hbasetests

SATD	  todo implement implicit asyncrddactions conversion instead of jcmonitor todo how to handle stage failures 	 
SATD	  todo should we check isassignablefrom 	 
SATD	  for replication addptns we need to follow a insertifnotexist alterifexists scenario todo ideally we should push this mechanism to the metastore because otherwise we have no choice but to iterate over the partitions here	 
SATD	  todo should we create the batch from vrbctx and reuse the vectors like below future work	 
SATD	  this is a hacky way of doing the quotes since it will match any of these so hello this is something to split would be considered to be quoted	 
SATD	  todo do the type checking of the expressions	 
SATD	  make a tree out of the filter todo this is all pretty ugly the only reason we need all these transformations is to maintain support for simple filters for hcat users that query metastore if forcing everyone to use thick client is out of the question maybe we could parse the filter into standard hive expressions and not all this separate tree	 
SATD	  not safe to continue for rsgbygbylim kind of pipelines see hive for more	 
SATD	  hack for tables with no columns treat it as a table with a single column called col

SATD	  we only support limited unselected column following by order by todo support unselected columns in genericudtf and windowing functions we examine the order by in this query block and adds in column needed by order by in select list	 
SATD	  todo if we want to be explicit about this dump not being a replication dump we can uncomment this else section but currently unneeded will require a lot of golden file regen if we do so	 
SATD	  todo refactor this in hive 	 
SATD	  todo a and not a is null can be potentially folded earlier into a noop	 
SATD	  todo remove this hb for now adding because reloptutilclassifyfilters has an assertion about column counts that is not true for semijoins	 
SATD	  todo this seems to indicate that priorities change too little perhaps we need to adjust the policy	 
SATD	  note we need srcfs rather than fs because it is possible that the files lists files which are from a different filesystem than the fs where the files file itself was loaded from currently it is possible for eg to do repl load hdfs ip dir and for the files in it to contain hdfs name entries andor viceversa and this causes errors it might also be possible that there will be a mix of them in a given files file todo revisit close to the end of replv dev to see if our assumption now still holds and if not so optimize	 
SATD	  note with some trickery we could add logic for each type in confvars for now the potential spurious mismatches eg and for float should be easy to work around	 
SATD	  fixme hiveserver siteurl is not settable 	 
SATD	  the following check is only a guard against failures todo knowing which expr is constant in gby s aggregation function arguments could be better done using metadata provider of calcite check the corresponding expression in exprs to see if it is literal	 
SATD	  todo remove in hive this is required only to support the deprecated hcataddpartitiondescbuilder interfaces	 
SATD	  todo if partitions are loaded lazily via the iterator then we will have to avoid conversion of everything here as it defeats the purpose	 
SATD	  figures out the aliases for whom it is safe to push predicates based on ansi sql semantics the join conditions are left associative so a right outer join b left outer join c inner join d is interpreted as a right outer join b left outer join c inner join d for inner joins both the left and right join subexpressions are considered for pushing down aliases for the right outer join the right subexpression is considered and the left ignored and for the left outer join the left subexpression is considered and the left ignored here aliases b and d are eligible to be pushed up todo further optimization opportunity for the case ac bc and bc cc a and b are first joined and then the result with c but the second join op currently treats a and b as separate aliases and thus disallowing predicate expr containing both tables a and b such as ac ac such predicates also can be pushed just above the second join and below the first join param op join operator param rr row resolver return set of qualified aliases 	 
SATD	  todo not stopping umbilical explicitly as some taskkill requests may get scheduled during querycomplete which will be using the umbilical hive should fix this until then leave umbilical open and wait for it to be closed after max idle timeout s default	 
SATD	  todo mm gap by design noone seems to use lb tables they will work but not convert it s possible to work around this by recreating and reinserting the table	 
SATD	  todo should be moved out	 
SATD	  todo io threadpool could be here one thread per stripe for now linear	 
SATD	  optionally do some filtering of rows undone	 
SATD	  todo should have a check on the server side embedded metastore throws invalidobjectexception remote throws tapplicationexception	 
SATD	  fixme support pruning dynamic partitioning	 
SATD	  fixme sideeffect will leave the last query set at the session level	 
SATD	  todo use faster nonsync inputstream	 
SATD	  todo should this rather use a threadlocal for numa affinity 	 
SATD	  todo this object is created once to call one method and then immediately destroyed so it s basically just a roundabout way to pass arguments to a static method simplify 	 
SATD	  todopc implement max	 
SATD	  todo make sure this method is eventually used to find the prep batch scripts	 
SATD	  this doesn t throw any exceptions because we don t want the compaction to appear as failed if stats gathering fails since this prevents cleaner from doing it s job and if there are multiple failures auto initiated compactions will stop which leads to problems that are much worse than stale stats todo longer term we should write something compaction queuecq meta info this is a binary field so need to figure out the msg format and how to surface it in show compactions etc 	 
SATD	  todo transitive dependencies warning 	 
SATD	  we are in hs get the token locally todo coordinator should be passed in hive must be initialized for now	 
SATD	  todo ideally acidutils class and various constants should be in common	 
SATD	  hack we actually need blockmissingexception but that is not available	 
SATD	  todo hive handling of dummyops and propagating abort information to them	 
SATD	  todo this at least for the session pool will always be the hive user how does doas above this affect things 	 
SATD	  todo this is currently broken we need to set memory manager to a bogus implementation to avoid problems with memory manager actually tracking the usage	 
SATD	  todo for oneblock case we could move notification for the last block out of the loop	 
SATD	  todo figure out a better data structure for node list 	 
SATD	  why isn t ppd working it is working but storage layer doesn t do row level filtering only row group level	 
SATD	  note currently this implementation does not fall back to regular copy if distcp is tried and it fails we depend upon that behaviour in cases like replication wherein if distcp fails there is good reason to not plod along with a trivial implementation and fail instead	 
SATD	  todo this is never used	 
SATD	  todo versions could also be picked at build time	 
SATD	  a previous solution is based on tablealias and colalias which is unsafe esp when cbo generates derived table names see hive for correctness purpose we only trust colexpmap we assume that cbo can do the constantpropagation before this function is called to help improve the performance unionoperator limitoperator and filteroperator are special they should already be columnposition aligned	 
SATD	  hack refactor once the metadata apis with types are ready	 
SATD	  todo if this cannot evict enough it will spin infinitely terminate at some point 	 
SATD	  but it is not ok to convert if the join is on ac	 
SATD	  todo ideally we should have a test for session itself	 
SATD	  todo if needed verify that recordschema entry for fieldname matches appropriate type	 
SATD	  fixme null value is treated differently on the other endwhen those filter will be	 
SATD	  todo br change the output colexprnodecolumn names to external names br verify if we need to use the keyvalue in rs cols switch to external names if possible br in exprnode in columninfo the tablealiasvirtualcolumn is specified differently for different gbrs in pipeline remove the different treatments virtualcolmap needs to be maintained 	 
SATD	  replace the entire current diskrange with new cached range in case of an inexact match in either of the below it may throw we do not currently support the case where the caller requests a single cache buffer via multiple smaller subranges if that happens this may throw noone does it now though todo should we actively assert here for cache buffers larger than range 	 
SATD	  todo fill in when partition done event is supported	 
SATD	  todo for now this affects non broadcast unsorted cases as well make use of the edge property when it s available	 
SATD	  todo most other options are probably unrecoverable throw 	 
SATD	  this is a temporary hack to fix things that are not fixed in the compiler	 
SATD	  should be fixed in accumulo and 	 
SATD	  this is hackery but having hivecommon depend on standalonemetastore is really bad because it will pull all of the metastore code into every module we need to check that we aren t using the standalone metastore if we are we should treat it the same as a	 
SATD	  todo fix this it has to run in since tables may be unbucketed	 
SATD	  not sure why this method doesn t throw any exceptions but since the interface doesn t allow it we ll just swallow them and move on this okish since releaselocks is only called for roac queries it would be really bad to eat exceptions here for write operations	 
SATD	  todo implement this when tez is upgraded tez 	 
SATD	  todo there should be a better way to do this code just needs to be modified	 
SATD	  todo session reuse completely disabled for doastrue always launches a new session	 
SATD	  todo in case of a failure to heartbeat tasks for the specific dag should ideally be killed	 
SATD	  todo check if all required tables are allowed if so get it from cache	 
SATD	  todo only the qualified name should be left here	 
SATD	  fixme this is a secret contract reusein getaggrkey creates a more closer relation to the statsgatherer	 
SATD	  note it s not quite clear why this is done inside this if seems like it should be on the top level	 
SATD	  todo why is this synchronized 	 
SATD	  todo local cache is created once so the configs for future queries will not be honored	 
SATD	  support for dynamic partitions can be added later the following is not optimized insert overwrite table t ds hr select key value hr from t where ds where t and t are bucketed by the same keys and partitioned by ds hr	 
SATD	  fixme using real scaling by newold ration might yield better results
