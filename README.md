# Custom NLP Model Demo Code

A custom-written demo using Stanford NLP to accomplish the goal of finding and logging self-admitted technical debt. This code exists as a heavily modified version of https://github.com/Naplues/MAT

Simply run ***src/main/Main.java*** and observe the statistics calculated once the run has completed.

Testing set size can be modified by changing **TEST_SET_SIZE** in ***src/main/NLP.java***
